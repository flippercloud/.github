# Flipper Cloud
[Flipper is an open-core feature flag library]([url](https://github.com/flippercloud/flipper)) for Ruby/Rails applications.

## Benefits of Flipper & Feature Flags
How can feature flags improve your workflows and release process? Just imagine having the confidence to release new code on a Friday afternoon? 

- 🆕 **Provide Early Access** Get real feedback sooner by shipping new features to production behind a feature flag, and then enabled individually for developers and groups of users.
- 🏗️ **Roll Out Incrementally** Avoid performance surprises by slowly rolling out new features to a percentage of users, organizations, specific countries, or whatever segments you define.
- 🚀 **Reduce Risk of Launches** When your feature has already been in production for weeks behind a feature flag, there's no need to wait for last-minute deploys. Toggle it on with a single click.
- ☑️ **Let Users Opt-in** Minimize disruption by letting your users decide when they want to get familiar with a drastic interface redesign and let your most eager users try it early.
- 🔐 **Control Permissions** Whether limiting access to premium features or giving teammates and contributors access to administrative features, feature flags make permissions simple.
- 😈 **Block Bad Actors** Flipper's feature checks are always blazing fast, so you can quickly and easily block bad actors that are abusing your app and rest assured your app is unaffected.
- 🛠️ **Perform Maintenance** Planned or not, feature flags let you limit downtime by disabling only affected features while leaving the rest of the application fully accessible.
- 🧪 **Run Experiments** Preview how a change affects real users in production by enabling an experimental feature for a percentage of users and then measure the results.
- 🌅 **Sunset Old Features** Sunset features the same way you roll them out. Once a feature is disabled, you can untangle and remove it from the code base without risk.

## Why Flipper Cloud?
- ⚙️ **Simple install and setup** [Getting started](https://www.flippercloud.io/docs/get-started) with Flipper is as easy as including _a few lines of code_ into your app. If your app is already using open source Flipper, using Flipper Cloud is as easy as updating your adapter and deploying.
- ⤵️ **Cascading environments** We understand the difficulty in managing features through [multile environments](https://www.flippercloud.io/docs/cloud#environments). With Flipper Cloud, you can set a feature in a non-production environment to simply _mirror the production setting_.
- 📓 **Audit history** Flipper Cloud keeps [a history](https://www.flippercloud.io/docs/cloud#audit-history) of all feature changes, and who made them. Easily _revert to a point in time_, or check to make sure a release strategy was followed, and when it was enabled.
- 🎛️ **Advanced flexibility** Different types of [features](https://www.flippercloud.io/docs/features) require _different release strategies_. Enable features for everyone, specific actors (eg. users), groups of users, a percentage of actors, or a percentage of time.
- 💫 **Independent availability** With multiple levels of adapters and [reads that are local to your application](https://www.flippercloud.io/docs/cloud#webhooks), you'll have blazing fast feature checks that are always available and in sync, even if Flipper Cloud isn't for some reason.
- 🔮 **Future proof** Because Flipper Cloud is simply an extra adapter around the open-source version of Flipper, even if Flipper Cloud goes down or closes, your features, code, and strategies _will always be available_.
